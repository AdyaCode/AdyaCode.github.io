	  <p>E-commerce security is the protection of all the ecommerce assets of your company from unauthorized use. It is the implementation of measures to protect your online presence and store from hacks or any other cyber threat. It usually involves a series of protocols to secure the customer and the store. Some tips to improve ecommerce security include: adding a firewall, using robust passwords, and making use of 2FA.</p></span>

	  <span class="point"><h3 id="link-2">What is e-commerce security and why it is so important ?</h3>
	  <p>E-commerce site security is critical for a number of reasons, specifically when it comes to protecting the privacy and sensitive data of customers on a website, safeguarding the finances of an online business, preventing fraud and financial scams and defending the reputation of an online store as a safe place to conduct.</p></span>
	  
	  <h2 id="link-3">What are the security risks of e-commerce ?</h2>
	  <p>Many cybersecurity threats abound and pose serious risks for online businesses. Just a few of these include:</p>
	  <img src="C:\Users\atasi\Desktop\Adya_SPS_Works_Projects\Adya_website_cyber_bullying\download (1).jpg" id="pic-3">
	  <ul>
	      <li class="content">Phishing</li>
		  <p>This threat is when your customers are sent fraudulent emails by scammers that purportedly come from your business. Being that your business name is used, your customers may incorrectly click on the links contained within and, in turn, are led to malicious pages where their passwords, usernames and payment info are fraudulently obtained.</p>
		  <li class="content">DDoS Attack</li>
		  <p>Online businesses themselves are specifically targeted in this type of attack. DDoS means “Distributed Denial of Service” and, just like the meaning implies, it makes your website completely inaccessible by overwhelming it with traffic from a malicious source, preventing customers from using it at all.</p>
		  <li class="content">Malware</li>
		  <p>This is another eCommerce security threat that’s very common. When attackers gain access to a given website and its code, they insert a malicious code of their own called malware which, in turn, latches on to site visitors, targeting their personal information and any sensitive data they might have on their devices.</p>
		  <li class="content">Trojan Horses</li>
		  <p>These are programs used by attackers to swipe sensitive information from computers and mobile devices of their targets. This is accomplished when customers and website administrators unknowingly download these seemingly-harmless programs, allowing attackers to steal sensitive and private data.</p>
		  <li class="content">XSS</li>
		  <p>With XSS (Cross Site Scripting), hackers exploit vulnerable web applications and inject malicious codes in them, posing a serious risk to users.</p>
		  <img src="C:\Users\atasi\Desktop\Adya_SPS_Works_Projects\Adya_website_cyber_bullying\images.jpg" id="pic-2">
		  <li class="content">SQL Injections</li>
		  <p>This threat comes through query submission forms found on websites. The attackers’ intent is to access the site’s database. By injecting malicious code into the database, the attackers are able to steal the website’s data.</p>
          <p>Other threats you should be wary of include ransomware, financial fraud, spam, bots, brute force attacks and more.</p>
      </ul>

	  <h1 id="link-4">For Customers</h1>
      <div><ol>
	  <li class="list-headings">Shop where you trust</li>
	  <p>Shopping IRL (in real life) offers this advantage: You’ll usually know the business and the inventory exist. But on the web, some businesses are fabricated by people who just want your credit card information and other personal details. Consider doing online business only with retailers you trust and have shopped with before.</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Beware rock-bottom prices</li>
	  <p>If a website offers something that looks too good to be true—like rock-bottom prices or an endless supply of free smartphones—then it probably is. Use similar websites to compare prices and pictures of the merchandise. Perpetually low prices could be a red flag that the business doesn’t have those items in stock. The website may exist only to get your personal information.</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Avoid public Wi-Fi</li>
	  <p>Wi-Fi networks use public airwaves. With a little tech know-how and the freely available Wi-Fi password at your favorite coffee shop, someone can intercept what you’re looking at on the web. That can include emails, browsing history or passwords. Shopping online usually means giving out information that an identity thief would love to grab, including your name and credit card information. Bottom line: It’s never a good idea to shop online or log in to any website while you’re connected to public Wi-Fi.</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Use a VPN</li>
	  <p>If you must shop online on public Wi-Fi, use a VPN (virtual private network). A VPN creates an encrypted connection between your computer and the VPN server. Think of it as a tunnel your Internet traffic goes through while you browse the web. Hackers lurking nearby can’t intercept it, even if they have the password for the Wi-Fi network you’re using. A VPN means you’ll likely have a safe way to shop online while you’re on public Wi-Fi.</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Use a strong password</li>
	  <p>If someone has the password to your account, they can log in, change the shipping address, and order things while you get stuck with the bill. Help keep your account safe by locking it with a strong password. Here are some tips on how:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Use a complex set of lowercase and uppercase numbers, letters, and symbols.</li>
      <li>Avoid words that come from a dictionary.</li>
      <li>Don’t use personal information that others can find or guess, such as birthdates, your kids’ names or your favorite color.</li>
      <li>And don’t use the same password—however strong—on multiple accounts. A data breach at one company could give criminals access to your other, shared-password accounts.</li>
      </ul>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Check out the webpage security</li>
	  <p>You’ve probably seen that small lock icon in the corner of your URL field. That lock signals you that the web page you’re on has privacy protection installed. It’s called a “secure sockets layer.” Plus, the URL will start with “https,” for “hyper text transfer protocol secure.” These websites mask and transfer data you share, typically on pages that ask for passwords or financial info. If you don’t see that lock or the “s” after “http,” then the webpage isn’t secure. Because there is no privacy protection attached to these pages, we suggest you exercise caution before providing your credit card information over these sites.</p>
	  
	  li class="list-headings">Watch out for email scams</li>
	  <p>Sometimes something in your email in-box can stir your consumer cravings. For instance, it might be tempting to open an email that promises a “special offer.” But that offer could be special in a bad way. Clicking on emails from unknown senders and unrecognizable sellers could infect your computer with viruses and malware. It’s better to play it safe. Delete them, don’t click on any links, and don’t open any attachments from individuals or businesses you are unfamiliar with.</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Don’t give out more information than you need to</li>
	  <p>Here’s a rule of thumb: No shopping website will ever need your Social Security number. If you’re asked for very personal details, call the customer service line and ask whether you can supply some other identifying information. Or just walk away.</li>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings"> Pay with a credit card</li>
	  <p>When using a credit card, you’ll usually get the best liability protection—online and offline. Here’s why:
	  <ul>
      <li>If someone racks up unauthorized charges on your credit card, federal regulations say you won’t have to pay while the card company investigates. Most major credit cards offer $0 liability for fraudulent purchases.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, your liability for unauthorized charges on your debit card is capped at $50, if you report it within two business days. But if someone uses your account and you don't report the theft, after 60 days you may not be reimbursed at all.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Try a virtual credit card</li>
	  <p>Some banks offer nifty tools that act like an online version of your card: a virtual credit card. The issuer will randomly generate a number that’s linked to your account, and you can use it anywhere online and choose when the number expires. It might be best to generate a new number every time you buy something online, or when you shop with a new retailer. Anyone who tries to use that number will be out of luck</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Check your statements regularly</li>
	  <p>Check your statements for fraudulent charges at least once a week, or set up account alerts. When you receive a text or email about a charge, you can check the message and likely easily recall whether you made the charge.</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Mind the details</li>
	  <p>After you make the purchase, keep these items in a safe place: the receipt, order confirmation number and postal tracking number. If you have a problem with the order, this information will help the merchant resolve the problem.</li>
	   
      <li class="list-headings">Take action if you don’t get your stuff</li>
	  <p>Call the merchant and provide the details noted in Tip 13. If the merchant turns out to be fake, or they’re just plain unhelpful, then your credit card provider can help you sort out the problem. Often, they can remove the charge from your statement.</p>
	  
	  <li class="list-headings">Report the company</li>
	  <p>If you suspect the business is bogus, notify your credit card company about the charge and close your account. File a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>
	  </ol></div>
	  
       <h1 id="link-5">For Sellers</h1>
	   <div class="division"><ol>
       <li class="list-headings-2">Use SSL and ensure that your website is PCI compliant</li>
	   <p>SSL has grown to be a necessary security measure. SSL stands for secure sockets layer, and it is used to encrypt the connection between a computer and the server it is connected to. You’ll know that a site has SSL if it uses HTTPS instead of the traditional HTTP in the address, and that there is a lock in the URL bar as well.</p>
       <p>However, purely relying on SSL is not seen as enough protection by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). You’ll need to keep track of the ever-evolving security rules that PCI DSS prescribes not only for the sake of being PCI compliant and avoiding fines and penalties, but also to be able to keep your site holistically protected.</p>
	   
	   <li class="list-headings-2">Use a real-time bot detection technology</li>
	   <p>Studies have shown that as much as 50% of web traffic comes from bots. And with as much as 30% of e-commerce fraud coming from malicious bots, it is essential for you to have the technology to identify and block off bad bots.</p>
       <p>There are many available bot detection tools out there but it is best to asses which ones can provide the best real-time protection, as a lot of harm can be done in just a few seconds. It is vital that the tool that you choose can recognize and effectively eliminate bots from your site.</p>
	   
	   <li class="list-headings-2">Use a web application firewall for network level security</li>
	   <p>Web application firewalls or WAFs are used to protect web-facing applications against attacks. Having it is part of the mandates of PCI DSS. Web application firewalls specifically monitor web-based traffic, block malicious software, and helps to keep your site, as well as customers who are transacting on your site, protected.</p>
	   
	   <li class="list-headings-2">Select a secure e-commerce platform</li>
	   <p>Perhaps a step that should be taken into consideration from the beginning is the integrity of the platform which would host your whole site. There are many options available, and each has its unique offerings.</p>
       <p>Note that your decision should not just be on the cost of putting your site up. It should also include the performance it can support, as well as the security protocols that it implements. It is usually best to choose a trusted platform instead of risking with a new player. This ensures that your site will indeed be protected from hackers.</p>
	   
	   <li class="list-headings-2">Have a system in place for purging customer data</li>
	   <p>One way to minimize the risk of having a major data breach is by not keeping a lot of customer data, especially long after the data has been used. When the data is no longer critical, make sure to keep it safe from being used for the wrong purpose. Retain only vital information for the transactions and remove what you do not need after some reasonable time.</p>
	   
	   <li class="list-headings-2">Insist on customers using strong passwords</li>
	   <p>While you can come up with many security measures for your site, your users may be compromising themselves by using accounts that are too easy to crack. This involves the use of simple passwords that are easy to guess. Doing this puts them in a lot of danger, especially when they leave out their payment information on your site. Once their accounts are compromised, the hacker can freely take advantage of the use of their payment channels.</p>
       <p>So when a customer comes up with an account for your site, make sure that you request to use strong passwords, such as those that need to have a blend of capital letters, small letters, and numbers. Some even go as far as requiring special characters, but that may end up being too difficult to remember.</p>
	   
	   <li class="list-headings-2">Be vigilant about online security</li>
	   <p>Finally, you must make sure that you are constantly striving to keep your business and your customers safe. It is your dedication and commitment to come up with a secure online shopping or obtaining cash advance online environment that will push you to avail of security measures and perform best security practices that will keep your e-commerce site from getting hacked. By doing this, you’ll be able to win your customer’s trust and gain a lot more sales.</p>
       <p>With all these measures, your site is at least seven levels safer from hackers. Never ignore your business and your customers security and you will bear abundant fruits.</p>
